          <p>
            My name is Cody Martin, and I am working towards a new and fulfilling career path.
            My college journey began with the intention of being a physical therapist, because of my passion for sports.
            Frequently injured, I had a desire to figure out why it was happening and how
            to best fix it. After a few years of school, the field didn't feel quite right. I was
            later exposed to the idea of web development as a career through friends and acquaintances.
          </p>
          <p>
            I found that the problem-solving in web development was something that I enjoyed. The problems were
            more logical and consistant compared to the peculiarities of the human body that I had been studying. Over the course of
            the last year, I have been searching online to learn more by reading articles, watching
            videos, and participating in introductory courses. I am confident I will build up the skills
            and knowledge needed to make a career for myself in web development.
